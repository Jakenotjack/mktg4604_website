Create a visual storyboard for the following story.

Number of panels (N): {{NUM_PANELS}}

Preferred style hint (optional):
"{{STYLE_HINT}}"

Story:
"""
{{STORY_TEXT}}
"""

Instructions:
- Use the style hint if it is non-empty by incorporating it into "global_style"
  and into each "image_prompt".
- If the style hint is empty, choose a style that fits the story (for example,
  cozy watercolor for a gentle story, dramatic digital painting for an epic one).
- Make sure the sequence of panels covers the beginning, middle, and end of the story.
- Return the result in the exact JSON format specified in the system instructions.
